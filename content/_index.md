Who am I ?

You can find my [Github](https://github.com/gowind) here

I love programming for fun (and work ofcourse). Polyglot, I practically code everything from Github YAMLs
to backends to React (just don't ask me to write CSS :P). Actually no, I don't mind writing CSS either.
Currently in love with Zig and very familiar with Typescript, Python (and Clojure though I haven't touched it in a long time)

I love low-level programming and diving deep into the machine. I wrote a lot of the articles based on my attempts to understand Operating Systems, runtimes and how "magic" features work at the fundamental level.

Do you think you have interesting problems to solve that I can help with? Reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/DeepknowledgeU) or just email me at petrovgovind dot gmail dot com. In the email subject, please mention "Big Kahuna Burger" so that I know how you found me :)  

Physically, I live somewhere in the GMT+01:00 timezone. Ethereally, I am omnipresent.
