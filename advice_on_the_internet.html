<h1 id="advice-on-the-internet">Advice on the internet</h1>
<p>TL;DR: In today’s information rich world, Learning which advice to
ignore is a skill.</p>
<p>This post is not advice, rather observations based on experience.</p>
<p>I classify advice into 2 broad buckets</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tactical / specific advice</li>
<li>Generic advice</li>
</ol>
<p>Tactical / specific advice , is highly specific. This bucket, IMO,
consists of advice whose effectiveness can be gauged very accurately and
often very quickly.Stuck on a programming problem ? Ask a senior and he
can tell you how to solve it and you do. Need to file taxes ? Your tax
accountant helps you file taxes and reduces your tax burden. In this
case there is a strict material number attached to the gain you make for
his services.</p>
<p>Generic advice</p>
<p>Generic / strategic / philosphical advice. These are advice that are
“generic”, as in both applicable to large swaths of the population and
very broad, applicable to your life or career at any many points in
time. Gauging the effectiveness of such advice is hard, sometimes nigh
on impossible because the converse of these statements are often not
true. For example, take the statement: “hardwork makes you rich”. The
converse “being rich means you did hardwork” is not always true (or
heck, is not even necessary). Also words like “hardwork” and “rich” are
very subjective and for it to be a truly scientific statement, you need
to control for all other variables (circumstances, education, luck, the
exact year in which you did hardwork).</p>
<p>Generic advice is found everywhere on the internet today. The cost of
disbursing information has gone down ~0, so you will find everyone
handing out advice on how to live life, what are the right principles to
have in life, what you must do and what you must eat.</p>
<p>Tactical advice is relatively easy to evaluate 1. Is the advice from
a professional (i.e. someone getting paid for their speciality) and is
the advice for something related to that profession ? 2. and is there a
direct metric that tells me how much I stand to gain if following that
advice ?</p>
<p>Most of the time, the problem is identifying which of the “generic”
advice are valuable and which of them are pure BS. I used a few broad
principles to gauge how effective some piece of advice can be</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Most “generic” advice is useless proven otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to the sheer Noise to Signal ratio of advice flooded on the
internet, it is better to discard all new info first and then go pick
for valuable ones later, than to hold onto junk in your head.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It is never about the message. It is about the messenger</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Who</strong> gives which “generic” advice matters the most.
No one will take the daily wage labourer sleeping on the roadside saying
that “hardwork matters” seriously. But, when Narayana Murthy or Jeff
Bezos or John Carmack says the same thing, everyone perks up their ears.
Why ? because the latter are wealthy, and wealth is the signal that will
make people listen to you.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Follow the money</li>
</ol>
<p>** Follow the money** IMO is the most universal advice that I have
seen to be consistently true across domains, people and time.</p>
<p>What does the person giving me advice stand to gain from me following
the advice ? Take Paul Graham’s <a
href="https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a>. He gives a
lot of advice on startups, hardwork, what you should do and how you
should approach life, and they pretty much end up all end up with the
message implicit and explicit: do a startup. It makes sense why PG would
say that. He (used to, now retired) run Y Combinator, probably the most
famous tech accelerator in the world, which funds Startups in the Seed
stage. Given the abysmal statistics around the success rate of startups,
the more people that startup, the more options PG has and the more he
stands to make if every talented person pursues a startup in his
portfolio that hits it big. PG makes money from people following his
advice.</p>
<p>But is the advice useful to <strong>you</strong>: the follower ?
While it is true that YC startups have had billions of dollars of payoff
and made billionaires out of founders, the <a
href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp">statistics</a>
of starting up mean that the likelihood of a great payday that makes
money beyond your wildest dreams (or something that beats the earnings
over say 10 years of working at a FAANG) is probably close to zero. If
you factor in the conditionality of success (say, Stanford dropout,
living in Bay Area, being able to have a Harvard/Stanford co-founder),
the more average your background is , the smaller the empirical
probability of your personal success is.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Principal agent problem</li>
</ol>
<p>Imagine a housing broker that sells houses and gets a 3% commission
from both the buyer and the seller on the sale of a house. The broker,
while he might have been hired by you to find a house for you, on the
guarantee that he will find the best bargains and haggle with the seller
to make buying a house affordable for you, has every reason to increase
the price of a house as much as possible, for every rupee or dollar the
price goes up , his bottomline increases.</p>
<p>Take a fund manager charging a 2% carry per year (carry is the fees
as percentage of the total value of the fund being managed). The carry
is non-negotiable, so whether a funds performs or not, the fund manager
gets to pocket the carry irrespective of how well the fund performs. It
is very much in the interest of (especially terrible ones) fund managers
to maximise the sizes of the funds being managed, whereas you will have
your funds locked up for anywhere between 3-10 years that might have
made better returns just being invested in an index fund instead (and
probably also redeemable when needed)</p>
<p>What are online advice sellers gaining and more specifically what
hidden traps are there that you don’t see, should you choose to follow
that advice ? Follower count (yes, in my case, its not something world
changing, but the ego boost of seeing your follower count go up is very
much real) ? Do they stand to profit off your hardwork, leveraging it,
while you pay the opportunity cost of having a family, social life or
control over your time ? Do they have liquidity options that you don’t
(for example, founders can sell their equity in illiquid startup stock
on the secondary market, whereas you, the employee only gets worthless
ESOPs)</p>
<p>The thing is, most of the times, you will have to take these bargains
knowing that you are still at an disadvantage (eg. ESOPS and low salary
at a startup because you can’t find a job anywhere else, or you love the
startup and its missions so much that you are willing to take the
opportunity cost), but the awareness of the risk plays a role in how one
deals with the emotional turmoil of such bets. You can’t control the
outcomes, but if you know the risks better, you can for sure control
your reactions to the said outcomes. And to me that is the key: am I
equipped to deal with the emotional consequences of these outcomes ?</p>
