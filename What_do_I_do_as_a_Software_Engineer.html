<h3 id="a-software-engineer-is-a-professional.">A Software Engineer is a
professional.</h3>
<p>Who is a professional ? In my words, a professional is a high skilled
person, who can be relied upon to fulfil expectations in the area at
which he is skilled.</p>
<p>3 words are important here 1. skill 2. relied upon (reliability) 3.
expectations</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>As a Software Engineer, your skill is your ability to work with
software. You are programming software to fulfil expectations.</p>
<p>you employ your skill in software and programming, to do what needs
to be done.</p>
<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
<p>But what needs to be done ?</p>
<p>My team maintains a feature as a part of a large product that serves
100M+ customers all over the world. The feature provides incentives to
the user to continue using our product. The feature has a certain
definition and behaviour and must serve all the users on our
platform.</p>
<p>What my team (and therefore I) must do is a simple statement:
Identify and improve this feature to improve usage of our product and
retain more customers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Communication: To do this effectively, my team has to talk to
marketing managers to understand how they market our product and how we
can provide incentives to attract more customers. Since Marketing is
heavily dependent on the country/demographics/language of our audience,
we have to put in the effort to consider the various needs before adding
or extending the features.</li>
<li>Scale: We cannot launch features that cannot scale to our entire
customer base. so before we decide to add more features, we have to see
if we can reliably scale to extend our features to all of our users,
otherwise it will have a net impact</li>
<li>Planning and estimation: Developers are expensive. For anything we
set out to do, we must be capable of assessing the difficulty of tasks,
risks that might delay our estimates and most importantly plan the order
of things to be done, so that we aren’t wasting time doing a task that
will ultimately have to be discarded</li>
<li>Measurement and Analytics : most features are experimental in nature
(ie, you do not know if it made an impact or not). To gauge the success
of anything we add (or remove), we need to measure the impact. Our job
doesn’t just stop once we yeet our code changes into Production. We
provide tools and data to assess the impact of our changes so that PMs
and Marketing people can make informed decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how programming is a <em>critical</em> but small part of my
responsibilities. My work is a superset of programming related tasks.
What I am doing is anything and everything to support this feature that
my team is expected to maintain as a part of the larger product and the
company.</p>
<p>We get to the final part: how am I doing it ??</p>
<h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>
<p>Any automation/script is only as good as how many times you have to
manually intervene. If you have a computer, that is super fast, but has
to be restarted every 5 mins, it is worthless than a calculator because
you can never depend on it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the most talented developers are only as good as how long
they can be relied upon and how frequently their managers have to
“manage” them.</p>
<p>The best software developers are the ones that managers can forget
about knowing because they know that they can manage themselves.</p>
<p>The worst software developers are the ones that, like babies, need a
full-time caretaker to make sure they aren’t soiling themselves or
causing ruckus in the house or the nursery.</p>
<p>Your team and manager should be able to count on you to consistently
deliver, with the least amount of intervention possible.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that they never have to message you or setup a
meeting or provide you information or basically not talk to you at all,
nor does it mean you are expected to do everything by yourself without
seeking help.</p>
<p>Your manager and team are happy in the fact that you will seek help,
when needed, inform them of the status of your work, really dive into
the details and keep track of everything that needs to be done.</p>
