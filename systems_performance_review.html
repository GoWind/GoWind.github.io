<p>Brendan Gregg’s <a
href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2020-07-15/systems-performance-2nd-edition.html">System
Performance</a> is a book that I have been meaning to read for a long
time, but didn’t get around to. Thanks to my workplace’s education
policy, I get to buy and reimburse technical books, so I grabbed myself
a copy</p>
<p>Its a Hyuuuuge book (some 793 pages excluding the Introduction and
the Appendix) and I don’t think I will ever write a review if I wait
until I completed the entire book.</p>
<p>That said, even read a couple of chapters gave me enough intuition on
what to pursue further and my two biggest takeaways have been: 1. USE
and RED Methodologies 2. BPF (or eBPF) based tools</p>
<h2 id="use-and-red-methodologies">USE and RED methodologies</h2>
<p>USE stands for Utilization, Saturation and Errors. It is a
methodology for investigating systematic bottlenecks in System
Resources</p>
<p><strong>RESOURCE</strong> - components like CPU, RAM, Network
bandwidth etc. <strong>UTILIZATION</strong> - what % of a resource is
used, over time (5-minute avg utilization of a CPU) and space (number of
CPUs utilized by a program in a multi-threaded/multi-CPU system)</p>
<p>When utilization reaches 100% and more requests to utilize a resource
(such as new processes or incoming packets) come in, they are queued for
processing. This is a measure of extra <strong>pressure</strong> on the
system and is termed <strong>SATURATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>ERRORS</strong> - The number of error events (seg faults,
page faults) etc.</p>
<p>USE is a methodology for measuring how well system resources are
used.</p>
<p>As a user of a system (or service ) you don’t know (or care) about
system resources, rather about how well your requests to use the system
are doing. Example, if you are using AWS s3 to store data/files, then
you don’t care about how efficient s3 is in using system resources,
rather you want to know how quickly your request to store and fetch
data</p>
<p>In such cases, the <strong>RED methodology</strong>* is a better way
to track systematic bottlenecks RED stands for Requests Rate, Errors and
Duration.</p>
<p><strong>Request Rate</strong> - The rate at which user requests
arrive <strong>Errors</strong> - The number (or % ) of requests that
result in a (non-user induced) error <strong>Duration</strong> - The
duration it takes for requests to be served (measured by 50th, 90th,
99th percentiles etc)</p>
<h2 id="bpf-ebpf-based-tools">BPF (eBPF) based tools</h2>
<p>BPF is a way for users on Linux to load programs that run within the
kernel, without having to modify the kernel source codeOR load kernel
modules. While it start off with packet filter (as the name stands for
Berkely Packet Filter), it soon extended to other usecases as well.
using BPF, users can attach programs to various hooks in the kernel (for
example, you can run a program to track every time a read() system call
was executed, or a write()). BPF programs are written in a dialect of C.
Using BPF directly can be cumbersome, so Brendan Gregg’s <a
href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">BCC</a> project provides some
useful tools and utilities to make it easier to write, load and register
BPF programs. There is also a high-level scripting like language, <a
href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace">BPFtrace</a> that can be
programmed like a bash/awk script to do pretty much most of what you
need as a user to track application performance without having to write
programs in BPF’s C dialect</p>
