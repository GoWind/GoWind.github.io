# Govind's Site

Who am I ?

I am [DeepKnowledgeU](https://twitter.com/DeepknowledgeU) on X (I still like to call it Twitter)

You can find my [Github](https://github.com/gowind) here

I love programming for fun (and work ofcourse). Polyglot, I practically code everything from Github YAMLs
to backends to React (just don't ask me to write CSS :P)
Currently in love with Zig and very familiar with Typescript, Python (and Clojure though I haven't touched it in a long time)

Physically, I am based out GMT+01:00. Ethereally, I am omnipresent.
