<p>Systems programming is less about understanding a Systems programming
language (C, Rust, Zig) etc, and more about understanding the platfomr
(x86, ARM, Linux) etc.</p>
<p>After trying multiple times and failing to get a good understanding
of systems, I re-thought my approach to learning systems programming and
started at understanding the platform.</p>
<p>Here I start with Linux (and x86) and slowly make my way towards
understanding at a deep level how programs works on an operating system
and the hardware.</p>
<p>What is an ELF is currently being documented in [[From Source Code to
Hello World/Introduction]]</p>
<p>[[From Source Code to Hello World/What is <code>glibc</code>]] tries
to explain what glibc is and how it or something like it is essential to
any platform</p>
