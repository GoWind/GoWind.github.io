# Why I started this site ? 

** Om Namah Shivaya  ** 

Oct 2020 was a very eventful month for me. Days before the US election, I decided to unplug myself 
from the torrentous world of social media. 

Boom, a couple of clicks and my 12 years of presence on Twitter and Facebook simply vanished. 

Pretty sure some of the contents is lurking in some hard drive on one of FB's
datacenter somewhere (I think Twitter is honest enough when you delete your account), but at this point
it doesn't matter. 

I am not feeding that gluttonous monster anymore. 

I felt relieved, happy, relaxed. I did not have to put up a pretense of intellect, an aura of smartness or 
signs of wokeness. 

### Nothing. 


I was back to being me, writing as  I feel, without knowing how people judge or think about me. 
It is a powerful feeling. The ability to not give a fuck and simply express yourself as you please. 

Social media is a clusterfuck. The goal of any platform is to weaponize your attention, to steer it towards
an ever negative whirpool of shit, inanity and ephemeral outrage. Nothing gets solved, everything is turned
into a problem and more specifically, ** YOUR PROBLEM **.

The fundamental problem is ** BIG social media **. Instead of a federation of websites, as perhaps the original web
was envisioned, network effects deemed that everyone (or atleast the majority) converge onto one website. 

The ideology of sharing information has been usurped by the ever present need to monetize everything. Ads,
clicks, attention, eyeballs. The Matrix needs mindless zombies feeding on garbage and providing eyeballs to gorge
on advertisement, to keep it running, making billions for the overlords.

Sapped off their human curiosity, of their need to create, to explore. Only to consume what is given, without
complaining. 

I decided to change. Become a creator. Write, make things out of my hands. Take control of my attention back
from the monster. Inspire others to do so as well. Breakup the influence of Big Tech on our lives.

This blog is a beginning. I want to take my time to explore ideas, work on mini projects, create and share. 
As a start, I am hosting this site outside the purview of BIG Tech, in order to take back control of the web
and the internet from it. Maybe it won't be enough, but as Nishkarma Yoga says, the effort is of utmost importance,
irrespective of the outcome.
