<h1>Google Code Jam practice problem - Rotate</h1>
<h2>Problem definition is <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/544101/dashboard#s=p0">here</a></h2>
<p>In this problem, you are given a board of tiles named 'R' or 'B' or blank('.'). Given a NxN tile
you need to find if any or both of the players have K tiles lined up horizontally or vertically or diagonally. You can however rotate the board by 90 degrees clockwise, allowing pieces to fall due to gravity and then check for winners. </p>
<p>The following code solves the problem in Python. To check for winners. We use the following trick.
A matrix is created for tracking player 'R'. For each position in the board, we track the number of preceding 'R's in the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. If there are continuous 'R's the position of the 'R' in the current direction is encoded else it is left as 0. for eg, in the sequence 'RRRR' in the first row, the value for the third R is (0,3,0) indicating 3rd R in diagonal,horizontal and vertical directions respectively. If for any cell any of the values reaches K, then the player has won.</p>
