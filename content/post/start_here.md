title: What no one told me

Systems programming is less about understanding a Systems programming language (C, Rust, Zig) etc, and more about understanding the platfomr (x86, ARM, Linux) etc.

After trying multiple times and failing to get a good understanding of systems, I re-thought my approach to learning systems programming and started at understanding the platform. 

Here I start with Linux (and x86) and slowly make my way towards understanding at a deep level how programs works on an operating system and the hardware.

What is an ELF is currently being documented in  [[From Source Code to Hello World/Introduction]]

 [[From Source Code to Hello World/What is `glibc`]] tries to explain what glibc is and how it or something like it is essential to any platform
